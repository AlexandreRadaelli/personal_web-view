		<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello there! My name is Davide Radaelli, and I'm a year 1 university student at uwaterloo doing cs with an interest in the intersection between mathematics and physics regarding simulations. In my spare time, I like to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Deep dive into python's standard library</li>
			<li>Prove math stuff</li>
			<li>Learn math intuitively</li>
			<li>Make some simulations using opengl</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the past couple of years, I have prioritized all activities that could get me closer to my goal of improving simulation software using some form of AI. This includes greatly increasing my math and programming maturity by surrounding myself with proofs and other maths, as well as upgrading my coding workflow to use tools like bash, vim, tmux and others.</p>
		<p>I worked as a gymnastics coach nearly 3 years. Every day I came in with the mindset: "How can I influence these kids towards success?". I believe that only a handful of people (2 to 4) have any meaningful impact on peoples lives, and hopefully I was one of those people for the kids I coached. What if I was teaching my own kid? Or yours? There's something special about being genuine when teaching that makes it so great and rewarding. I don't coach anymore but I've moved on to other things I enjoy</p>
		<p>I'm working on a bunch of projects in math, physics and programming. The purpose of this website is to hopefully contain a (mostly) up-to-date log of all the stuff I'm doing.</p>
