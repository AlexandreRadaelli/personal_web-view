# Make It Feel Like a Video Game
*Jan 12, 2021*

I played lots of video games. Mainly Civ V, HOI4, Minecraft and LoL. It's ridiculously easy for me to enter a flow state while playing them. I can easily spend 8h straight on it.

Flow states can be powerful. Similar to video games, I can sometimes spend hours programming or learning math. But I still feel it's harder to enter productive flow states. This bothers me: why can't I easily get into video-game-like flow states while doing important work.

Adding structure is not the answer. Can you imagine blocking out time for video games? Thinking of it, I can. But not for the same reason that I block time for work. When I block time for work, I do it so I get stuff done. Whereas with games I block time to not go overboard!

To enter flow states, you need to sincerely enjoy what you're doing. You cannot see it as a means to an end.

Think of your efforts in learning math or programming. Do you see it as a means to an end? If yes, then you are doing it wrong.

#### Special section for people who say they're "not a (insert subject) person"

If you don't enjoy a subject (math/coding/bio/etcetera), then you are doing it wrong. Plain and simple. Let me prove it.

People who enjoy the subject you demur are human. You are also human. Therefore you can also enjoy the subject.

*Corollary*: If you don't enjoy the subject, you are doing it wrong.

Geniuses don't do things because of money, clout, or any other ulterior motive. They do it because they sincerely enjoy it. You must do the same.

The best way to do this is to surround yourself with the right people. Find a community of people who also genuinely care about the subject, and you will be well on your way toward growing a passion for it.
