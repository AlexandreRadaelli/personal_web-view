# Quit The Training Ground ASAP
*Feb 1, 2021*

Being an activator is TERRIFYING. It's a lot more comfortable to adopt a "trainer" mindset. But you will grow slower if you do.

For a long time, I didn't consider myself capable of changing the world *right now*. I still felt myself "in training." If you have a vision, this is one of the biggest mistakes I think you can make.

A lot of people want to impact the world the Elon way. That is, start an unrelated company like zip2 and PayPal. When that company is successful, use the capital to create the initiative you genuinely are about (SpaceX, Tesla, Boring, Neuralink, OpenAI).

This might feel like the right way to execute your vision. But I think there is a massive pitfall that most people don't consider. *Many people are still working on an unrelated project for years of their life*.

It makes more sense to start working directly on what you care about. Unrelated startups can take much longer than you initially think. For example, Larry Page started Google in 2001, and only recently in 2019 did he finally step down. Supposing he was doing all this to make money for a vision he had, he could have directly worked on his vision instead.

I'm not saying Larry and Elon are mistaken. Internet technologies were their vision. But when I see people justifying their interests this way, and saying that they're indirectly reaching their goal, I think they're wrong.

What about the opposite kind of person?

I would point to Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos. I totally disagree with the execution of her idea, but there is something to be said about the principle (CLARIFICATION: I TOTALLY disagree with the way she executed her idea. I've read 'Bad Blood' and I'm shocked at just how horrifying Theranos was). She didn't have any capital to speak of and convinced these rich investors to give her a load of money.

If your vision is really that good, then go and pitch it right now. Get really good at pitching it. And eventually, get money for it.

I believe more people should quit training mode. It's scary at first but worth it. You must stop lying to yourself.

I feel the best way to learn is by doing. I am 10 times more productive now that I'm actively pursuing my goal of curing ageing.
