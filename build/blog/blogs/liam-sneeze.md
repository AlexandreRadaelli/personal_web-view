# Liam Sneezed On Me
*Jan 15, 2021*

*No, Liam did not actually sneeze on me. This is about memetic theory. If you don’t know about memetics, I encourage you to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc&list=LLdHOFqbEXljMVlPA7I46ehw&index=2055) CGP Grey video.*

Months ago I had a great spontaneous chat with Liam. One of those chats that you remember for a long time. And he shocked me. He was moving to a hacker house in New Mexico!

So ambitious. And he’s the same age as me so I can’t use no age excuse.

At the time I didn’t know much about hacker houses, but I knew in the back of my head this was something I wanted to do.

I’m a total believer in the idea that you are the average of your five closest friends. And a hacker house is the perfect place to make five ideal friends.

Time went on. I found my own hacker house [edyfi.co](https://edyfi.co/). I talked to many people about it. Turns out some people going to Edyfi we’re also inspired by Liam!

And so I wondered to myself… How impactful has Liam’s decision to move to New Mexico been?

According to memetics, Liam sneezed on all of us. And we all got infected. Incredible. So many interesting questions!

Who sneezed on Liam? Is there a patient zero? Damn that patient zero must have been a genius. Zero has influenced so many people indirectly with his idea germ. Of course, his idea mutated along the way and became more infectious.

A lot of things in the world can be seen using this framework. Building up a brand for yourself is essentially building up a germ center where people chose to infect themselves with the disease.

One of my big goals is to set up a germ center. A brand for myself. I would be able to spread my anti-ageing message to the world. Kind of like religion comes to think of it. The anti-ageing religion.

In effect, this video is also a germ. Maybe even a super germ. Of course, only time will tell.
