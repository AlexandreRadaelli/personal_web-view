# Quantum Mechanics Bootcamp
*Feb 23, 2021*

To do good in anything related to quantum, you must be good at math. Imagine having the same intuition as Richard Feynman. You could make progress and contribute easily.

I'm starting a group with precisely that goal.

Using a VERY unique way of learning.

When you show up, we have a topic picked beforehand. We've all done our research on said topic. Hours of research.

The lesson begins with somebody explaining the topic. Others are responsible for poking holes in that person's explanation. Said person must justify their answer against the onslaught of questions. When a hole is successfully poked, we all convene and try to find the answer together.

These are the main principles:

1. Teaching is the best way to learn. Intuition > Memorization. You might have heard this called the Feynman technique (of learning).

2. Abstract is good and feels natural with the proper context. Ex: doing calculus problems without calculus is a nightmare.

3. Question the obvious. Learn to be very skeptical when everyone talks about something as though it's obvious. Challenge their explanation.

This course is rigorous. We will be proceeding at a breakneck paceâ€”one lesson per day. Every lesson takes hours of prep. This is not an easy commitment. Think carefully before applying.

The curriculum is as follows:

- Day 1 - [Intro to propositional and predicate logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V49i_LM8B0E&list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&index=1)
- Day 2 - [Axioms of set theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAJB9l-HAZs&list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&index=2)
- Day 3 - [Classification of sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EIWRg-6ftQ&list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&index=3)
- Day 4 - [Topological spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wyOoLUjUeI&list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&index=4)
- Day 5 - [Topology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4SqIboeig&list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_&index=1)
- Day 6 - [Topological manifolds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93f-ayezCqE&list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_&index=2)
- Day 7 - [Multilinear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbv3T15nWq0&list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_&index=3)
- Day 8 - Big review
- Day X - To be decided after the big review

By the end of this course, you will have an undergrad-level understanding of quantum mechanics.

We may decide to continue that course to a Ph.D. level understanding.

You are free to quit at any point.
