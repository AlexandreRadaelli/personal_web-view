# Quantum Mechanics Mafia
*Feb 23, 2021*

PREREQUISITES: *NONE*

Named after the Paypal Mafia.

Some fancy things you will learn by participating: Formal proofs; ZFC axioms; Construction of N, Z, Q, R; Topological spaces; Manifolds, Multilinear algebra; Bundles, Tensors, Hilbert spaces, Lie algebra;

To do good in anything related to quantum, you must be good at math. Imagine having the same intuition as Richard Feynman. You could make progress and contribute easily.

We've starting a group with precisely that goal.

Using a VERY unique way of learning.

When you show up, we have a topic picked beforehand. We've all done our research on said topic. Hours of research.

The lesson begins with somebody explaining the topic. Others are responsible for poking holes in that person's explanation. Said person must justify their answer against the onslaught of questions. When a hole is successfully poked, we all convene and try to find the answer together.

These are the main principles:

1. Teaching is the best way to learn. Intuition > Memorization. You might have heard this called the Feynman technique (of learning).

2. Abstract is good and feels natural with the proper context. Ex: doing calculus problems without calculus is a nightmare.

3. Question the obvious. Learn to be very skeptical when everyone talks about something as though it's obvious. Challenge their explanation.

We are doing one session per week on sunday's. However every session takes hours of prep. This is not an easy commitment. Think carefully before applying.

The curriculum is as follows:

- Week 1 - [Intro to propositional and predicate logic](https://youtu.be/V49i_LM8B0E) | [Session 1](https://youtu.be/ya4rlh98vrw)
- Week 2 - [Axioms of set theory](https://youtu.be/AAJB9l-HAZs) | [Session 2](https://youtu.be/U36wuU01rhA)
- Week 3 - [Classification of sets](https://youtu.be/6EIWRg-6ftQ) | [Session 3](https://youtu.be/AdJfsmN2rF0)
- Week 4 - [Topology](https://youtu.be/7G4SqIboeig)
- Week 5 - [Topological manifolds](https://youtu.be/93f-ayezCqE)
- Week 6 - [Multilinear Algebra](https://youtu.be/mbv3T15nWq0)
- Week 7 - Big review
- Week X - To be decided after the big review

We are committed to long term learning. Consistancy is better then rushing a bootcamp.

To apply send me an email and I'll see what I can do to help you join.

## FAQ

### Do I need calculus? I don't feel ready for the course.

No. We are learning theoretical physics from first principles. Only logic and hard work is required.

### How will this help me with QC? I expect a course on QM to cover uncertainty, particles/waves, harmonic oscillator, time evolution of hamiltonians etc.

In this case that stuff is the flashy stuff. To get a deep understanding it goes like this:

logic -> set theory -> topology -> topological manifolds -> differentiable manifolds -> bundles -> symp./metric geometry -> quantum mechanics!

Don't misunderstand me: you can still make progress without this background material. But eventually you will need to learn it. Why not learn it like this? It's way more fun then reading textbooks by yourself.

### But I have X going on (global challenge/school/etc.)

When something is important, you make time for it. You probably waste ~2h everyday without realizing it. This is where time comes from when something's important.

This is a lot closer to a fiction reading club than a rigorous course. It will be enjoyable to learn math using this format. Spending hours won't even bother you.

If this is not sustainable for you, then I encourage you to quit it. I'm also a busy person! But I'm making sure this doesn't feel like work to me. Check out [my post on flow states](/blog/flow-games.html) for more info.

### University students spend years learning these subjects - how am I going to learn this in 1 week?

The idea is that it's a forcing function for constant exposure to mathematics. We're starting off hard with 1 session per day for 7 days, but then chilling and going slower.

And it's also a first principles approach to math. It all builds up from pure logic hence with enough hard work it will click.

For example consider child prodigies like Tarry Tao. The reason they get got so good is through constant exposure. They enjoyed it and so continued to expose themselves to the math.
