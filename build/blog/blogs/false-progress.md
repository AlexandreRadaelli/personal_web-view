# I Fooled Myself
*Mar 14, 2021*

My goal is to cure ageing. But in the last few weeks I've fallen into a dumb mindless status-quo flow state where I forget what the hell I was doing.

I prided myself in my ability to wake up thinking about how I would spend the day getting myself one step closer to curing ageing. But I've dropped the mindset.

There was a period of ~1 month where I believed that I could do genuinely important work. That period has ended.

It ended with my pivot into quantum.

This is dumb. The same thing happened with my pivot into fluid simulation and into molecular dynamics.

That regressive mindset ends now. It doesn't feel so crazy since I've already done it a few times before. At first it feels like jumping off a cliff. But then you are fully in charge. And that's the best feeling ever.

I have a lot resting on this working out.

What specifically am I going to do regarding quantum simulations? The end goal is to gain unique insights that nobody else in the world has.

Writing about state-of-the-art papers will be important.

Replicating them even more so.

But eventually I have to create my own success. That's what I'll do.

Funny thing that comes to mind is that TKS always seems to have such a good model for doing stuff. What I'm doing is essentially a focus.
