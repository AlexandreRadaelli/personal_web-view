# The Real Way of Learning to Program
*Mar 23, 2021*

Deploying a website. Using git for version management. Contributing to open source.

All of these things are important. But you're rarely taught how to do it.

If you wanna learn this stuff send me an email. Learning this metaprogramming stuff is one of the best decisions I made for my programming. I now enjoy programming instead of seeing it as a means to an end.

I recommend the course "missing semester of your CS education".

If you build cool stuff but don't know how to put it on a website for the world to see, you're wasting some of your time. You need to learn this stuff.
