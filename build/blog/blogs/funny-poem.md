# A Funny Poem For Cold Outreach
*Feb 3, 2021*

### Davide (Outreach)

Hi NAME,

I'm trying to build a quantum simulation of a cell. I plan to use it to cure ageing.

Does anybody in your lab have similar ambitions?

I'd appreciate the names of people who come to mind.

Best,
Davide

### Person (Answer)

This is way way way in the future if you are thinking atomististically. Sorry, no names come to mind

### Davide (Poem)

I have plenty of years to pursue this goal relentlessly. I believe in Gradatim Ferociter: step by step, ferociously.

I still have lots of steps to take!

What would you do in my shoes? This is something I genuinely want to do.

Do you personally want to help me plan? Just say no and I'll understand.

PS: even if you say no to me, I hope this message made you smile and happy!

### Person (Answer)

Study a PhD in quantum algorithms as your first goal

Good luck

## Moral

NAME is a very busy person, so I understand his point of view. However, I disagree with his answer that I need to get a Ph.D. as my first step. I want to start contributing right now.

I feel young people tend to be more innovative. More willing to take risks and think differently. And I believe they are essential in the growth process.

But instead of young people going out and pursuing their moonshot, they're instead working in a lab where some older person is the leading researcher in charge.

I'd like to change our institution to give more power and trust to young people. More opportunity to grow by failing early. I know my initiative to model a cell atomistically is likely to fail. But I want to try my best anyway. Because that's how I grow. Then the second time around, I might actually succeed. What is a failure if the only outcome is a lesson?
