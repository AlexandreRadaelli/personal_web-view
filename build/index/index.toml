I believe that only a handful of people (2 to 4) have any meaningful impact on peoples lives, and hopefully I was one of those people for the kids I coached. What if I was teaching my own kid? Or yours? There's something special about being genuine when teaching that makes it so great and rewarding. I don't coach anymore but I've moved on to other things I enjoy."""
