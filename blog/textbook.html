<h1 id="one-textbook-a-day">One Textbook A Day</h1>
<p><em>Jan 4, 2021</em></p>
<p>There is an awful paradox when it comes to self-learning math: we’re often suggested textbooks, courses and playlists, but we never end up listening to them! And sometimes that means missing out on some amazing content. Progress in math cannot be made overnight, and must instead be acquired over a long period.</p>
<p>What can we do about this? My solution is One Textbook A Day. First, whenever someone recommends something to me, I add it to a list. I’ve accumulated a long list of math-related content from recommendations. Some textbooks, some playlists, some fiction books, some lectures, some youtube videos. Nearly 150 in all.</p>
<p>Then on most nights, I run a <a href="https://github.com/MoreTacos/random_math">python script</a> to randomly output one of the entries. I consume the content for ~45 minutes. I’m very focused when reading, and I’m not afraid to go on tangents to search up terms I don’t understand. Every time I learn something new. Some of the material on the list is way beyond my level, and others are way below me. However, even when reading something beyond or below you, you can still learn a lot.</p>
<p>It feels like artificially growing a passion for a topic. Sometimes what I read isn’t good, but other times I end up enjoying it so much that I add it permanently to my schedule.</p>
<p>Let me give an example. I wanted to teach myself differential geometry, and while surfing Reddit I found a recommendation for Frederic Schuller’s lectures on the geometric anatomy of theoretical physics. I did want to listen to them but you know… just not right now. And normally that’s where I would have left it. Slowly forgetting it. However because of One Textbook A Day, I ended up listening to his lectures a few weeks later; and it was one of the best and most enjoyable sources I know of. I added it to my permanent schedule. He gives one of the most precise and articulate introductions to mathematics that I know of.</p>
<p>I feel the most appropriate way for me to end this blog is to end with a list of content that I would personally recommend. Maybe start your list?</p>
<ul>
<li>3blue1brown videos. Amazing on giving intuition for concepts you though we’re complicated</li>
<li>Frederic Schuller’s lectures on the geometric anatomy of theoretical physics. The entire course is about having a perfectly precise understanding of spacetime.</li>
<li>Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone. A nice resource that translates concepts from Category Theory to physics, topology, logic and computation.</li>
<li>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers. A biography of Paul Erdos, one of the most interesting mathematicians.</li>
<li>Learn you a Haskell for the great good! Introduction to Haskell, functional programming, and category theory. A very enjoyable book to go through.</li>
<li>Arrows, Structures and Functors: The Categorical Imperative. Introduction to category theory introduces a whole new way of thinking about math. Makes you think a ton about simple things.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more recommendations, feel free to reach out to me. Let me know if you try it out.</p>
