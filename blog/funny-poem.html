<p>Hi NAME,</p>
<p>I’m trying to build a quantum simulation of a cell. I plan to use it to cure ageing.</p>
<p>Does anybody in your lab have similar ambitions?</p>
<p>I’d appreciate the names of people who come to mind.</p>
<p>Best, Davide</p>
<h3 id="person-answer">Person (Answer)</h3>
<p>This is way way way in the future if you are thinking atomististically. Sorry, no names come to mind</p>
<h3 id="davide-poem">Davide (Poem)</h3>
<p>I have plenty of years to pursue this goal relentlessly. I believe in Gradatim Ferociter: step by step, ferociously.</p>
<p>I still have lots of steps to take!</p>
<p>What would you do in my shoes? This is something I genuinely want to do.</p>
<p>Do you personally want to help me plan? Just say no and I’ll understand.</p>
<p>PS: even if you say no to me, I hope this message made you smile and happy!</p>
<h3 id="person-answer-1">Person (Answer)</h3>
<p>Study a PhD in quantum algorithms as your first goal</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>NAME is a very busy person, so I understand his point of view. However, I disagree with his answer that I need to get a Ph.D. as my first step. I want to start contributing right now.</p>
<p>I feel young people tend to be more innovative. More willing to take risks and think differently. And I believe they are essential in the growth process.</p>
<p>But instead of young people going out and pursuing their moonshot, they’re instead working in a lab where some older person is the leading researcher in charge.</p>
<p>I’d like to change our institution to give more power and trust to young people. More opportunity to grow by failing early. I know my initiative to model a cell atomistically is likely to fail. But I want to try my best anyway. Because that’s how I grow. Then the second time around, I might actually succeed. What is a failure if the only outcome is a lesson?</p>
