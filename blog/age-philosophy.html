<p><em>Feb 2, 2021</em></p>
<p>My goal is to cure ageing by simulating a cell. And there are LOTS of philosophical questions associated with longevity research.</p>
<p>I have reached a paradox: every moment I spend thinking about the philosophy of ageing is a moment I don’t spend on actually curing it!</p>
<p>Caring about philosophy is at best entertainment. At worst it can make you believe that you are spending your time wisely.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do think entertainment does have value. I love spending hours thinking about the implications of what would happen to society if by some miracle we managed to cure ageing. But I’d rather cure ageing first, and think later.</p>
<p>The worst is that I’ve in the past believed that the time I spend thinking is in fact “good” time spent, when in fact it’s all an ILLUSION. An illusion of work - it feels like I’m doing work, but really what I’m doing is no better than playing a video game.</p>
<p>And in some cases, people are profiting off of naivety. Selling e-books and courses and apps promising me that “my mind will get stronger” and that I will somehow get closer to my goal.</p>
<p>I feel an important caveat is that I’m not trying to maximize happiness. At least not immediately. My goal is first to cure ageing. So all this rubbish I’ve been talking about would not apply to somebody who is trying to reach happiness. Especially if philosophising makes them happy.</p>
<p>And here’s the real meta play. This entire blog post has been about philosophy: my philosophy on philosophy. What a waste of time…</p>
