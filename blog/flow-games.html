<p><em>Jan 12, 2021</em></p>
<p>I played lots of video games. Mainly Civ V, HOI4, Minecraft and LoL. It’s ridiculously easy for me to enter a flow state while playing them. I can easily spend 8h straight on it.</p>
<p>Flow states can be powerful. Similar to video games, I can sometimes spend hours programming or learning math. But I still feel it’s harder to enter productive flow states. This bothers me: why can’t I easily get into video-game-like flow states while doing important work.</p>
<p>Adding structure is not the answer. Can you imagine blocking out time for video games? Thinking of it, I can. But not for the same reason that I block time for work. When I block time for work, I do it so I get stuff done. Whereas with games I block time to not go overboard!</p>
<p>To enter flow states, you need to sincerely enjoy what you’re doing. You cannot see it as a means to an end.</p>
<p>Think of your efforts in learning math or programming. Do you see it as a means to an end? If yes, then you are doing it wrong.</p>
<h4 id="special-section-for-people-who-say-theyre-not-a-insert-subject-person">Special section for people who say they’re “not a (insert subject) person”</h4>
<p>If you don’t enjoy a subject (math/coding/bio/etcetera), then you are doing it wrong. Plain and simple. Let me prove it.</p>
<p>People who enjoy the subject you demur are human. You are also human. Therefore you can also enjoy the subject.</p>
<p><em>Corollary</em>: If you don’t enjoy the subject, you are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Geniuses don’t do things because of money, clout, or any other ulterior motive. They do it because they sincerely enjoy it. You must do the same.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to surround yourself with the right people. Find a community of people who also genuinely care about the subject, and you will be well on your way toward growing a passion for it.</p>
