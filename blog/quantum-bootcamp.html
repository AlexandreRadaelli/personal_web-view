<p><em>Feb 23, 2021</em></p>
<p>PREREQUISITES: <em>NONE</em></p>
<p>To do good in anything related to quantum, you must be good at math. Imagine having the same intuition as Richard Feynman. You could make progress and contribute easily.</p>
<p>I’m starting a group with precisely that goal.</p>
<p>Using a VERY unique way of learning.</p>
<p>When you show up, we have a topic picked beforehand. We’ve all done our research on said topic. Hours of research.</p>
<p>The lesson begins with somebody explaining the topic. Others are responsible for poking holes in that person’s explanation. Said person must justify their answer against the onslaught of questions. When a hole is successfully poked, we all convene and try to find the answer together.</p>
<p>These are the main principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Teaching is the best way to learn. Intuition &gt; Memorization. You might have heard this called the Feynman technique (of learning).</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract is good and feels natural with the proper context. Ex: doing calculus problems without calculus is a nightmare.</p></li>
<li><p>Question the obvious. Learn to be very skeptical when everyone talks about something as though it’s obvious. Challenge their explanation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This course is rigorous. We will be proceeding at a breakneck pace—one lesson per day. Every lesson takes hours of prep. This is not an easy commitment. Think carefully before applying.</p>
<p>The curriculum is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V49i_LM8B0E&amp;list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&amp;index=1">Intro to propositional and predicate logic</a></li>
<li>Day 2 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAJB9l-HAZs&amp;list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&amp;index=2">Axioms of set theory</a></li>
<li>Day 3 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EIWRg-6ftQ&amp;list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&amp;index=3">Classification of sets</a></li>
<li>Day 4 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wyOoLUjUeI&amp;list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic&amp;index=4">Topological spaces</a></li>
<li>Day 5 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4SqIboeig&amp;list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_&amp;index=1">Topology</a></li>
<li>Day 6 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93f-ayezCqE&amp;list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_&amp;index=2">Topological manifolds</a></li>
<li>Day 7 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbv3T15nWq0&amp;list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_&amp;index=3">Multilinear Algebra</a></li>
<li>Day 8 - Big review</li>
<li>Day X - To be decided after the big review</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this course, you will have an undergrad-level understanding of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>We may decide to continue that course to a Ph.D. level understanding.</p>
<p>You are free to quit at any point.</p>
<p>Apply by sending me an email. I am accepting 5 people. The course is starting ~March 1st. For people in TKS, be careful: you have a challenge during that period. I personally think this is 10x more useful but you do you.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="do-i-need-calculus-i-dont-feel-ready-for-the-course.">Do I need calculus? I don’t feel ready for the course.</h3>
<p>No. We are learning theoretical physics from first principles. Only logic and hard work is required.</p>
<h3 id="how-will-this-help-me-with-qc-i-expect-a-bootcamp-on-qm-to-cover-uncertainty-particleswaves-harmonic-oscillator-time-evolution-of-hamiltonians-etc.">How will this help me with QC? I expect a bootcamp on QM to cover uncertainty, particles/waves, harmonic oscillator, time evolution of hamiltonians etc.</h3>
<p>In this case that stuff is the flashy stuff. To get a deep understanding it goes like this:</p>
<p>logic -&gt; set theory -&gt; topology -&gt; topological manifolds -&gt; differentiable manifolds -&gt; bundles -&gt; symp./metric geometry -&gt; quantum mechanics!</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand me: you can still make progress without this background material. But eventually you will need to learn it. Why not learn it like this? It’s way more fun then reading textbooks by yourself.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-have-x-going-on-global-challengeschooletc.">But I have X going on (global challenge/school/etc.)</h3>
<p>When something is important, you make time for it. You probably waste ~2h everyday without realizing it. This is where time comes from when something’s important.</p>
<p>This is a lot closer to a fiction reading club than a rigorous course. It will be enjoyable to learn math using this format. Spending hours won’t even bother you.</p>
<p>If this is not sustainable for you, then I encourage you to quit it. I’m also a busy person! But I’m making sure this doesn’t feel like work to me. Check out <a href="/blog/flow-games.html">my post on flow states</a> for more info.</p>
