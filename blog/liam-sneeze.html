<p><em>Jan 15, 2021</em></p>
<p><em>No, Liam did not actually sneeze on me. This is about memetic theory. If you don’t know about memetics, I encourage you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc&amp;list=LLdHOFqbEXljMVlPA7I46ehw&amp;index=2055">this</a> CGP Grey video.</em></p>
<p>Months ago I had a great spontaneous chat with Liam. One of those chats that you remember for a long time. And he shocked me. He was moving to a hacker house in New Mexico!</p>
<p>So ambitious. And he’s the same age as me so I can’t use no age excuse.</p>
<p>At the time I didn’t know much about hacker houses. But I knew this was something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I’m a <em>total</em> believer in the idea that you are the average of your five closest friends. A hacker house is the perfect place to make these five ideal friends.</p>
<p>Time went on. I later found my own hacker house <a href="https://edyfi.co/">edyfi.co</a>. I talked to many people about it. Turns out some people going to Edyfi we’re also inspired by Liam!</p>
<p>And so I wondered to myself… How impactful has Liam’s decision to move to New Mexico been?</p>
<p>According to memetics, Liam sneezed on all of us. And we all got infected. Incredible. So many interesting questionsto ask!</p>
<p>Who sneezed on Liam? Is there a patient zero? That patient zero must have been a genius. Zero has influenced so many people indirectly with his idea germ.</p>
<p>A lot of things in the world can be seen using this framework. Building up a brand for yourself is essentially building up a germ center where people chose to infect themselves with your thought disease.</p>
<p>One of my big goals is to set up a germ center. A powerful brand for myself. I’d be able to spread my anti-ageing message to the world. Kind of like religion comes to think of it. The anti-ageing religion.</p>
<p>In effect, this blog is also a germ. Maybe even a super germ?! Of course, only time will tell.</p>

<p>Another idea is that in addition of seeking to become patient zero of good ideas, you should also seek to become more susceptible to good infections.</p>
