<p><em>Mar 14, 2021</em></p>
<p>My goal is to cure ageing. But in the last few weeks I’ve fallen into a dumb mindless status-quo flow state where I forget what the hell I was doing.</p>
<p>I prided myself in my ability to wake up thinking about how I would spend the day getting myself one step closer to curing ageing. But I’ve dropped the mindset.</p>
<p>There was a period of ~1 month where I believed that I could do genuinely important work. That period has ended.</p>
<p>It ended with my pivot into quantum.</p>
<p>This is dumb. The same thing happened with my pivot into fluid simulation and into molecular dynamics.</p>
<p>That regressive mindset ends now. It doesn’t feel so crazy since I’ve already done it a few times before. At first it feels like jumping off a cliff. But then you are fully in charge. And that’s the best feeling ever.</p>
<p>I have a lot resting on this working out.</p>
<p>What specifically am I going to do regarding quantum simulations? The end goal is to gain unique insights that nobody else in the world has.</p>
<p>Writing about state-of-the-art papers will be important.</p>
<p>Replicating them even more so.</p>
<p>But eventually I have to create my own success. That’s what I’ll do.</p>
<p>Funny thing that comes to mind is that TKS always seems to have such a good model for doing stuff. What I’m doing is essentially a focus.</p>
