<p><em>Jan 10, 2021</em></p>
<p>A part of my plan for computational longevity is to cure ageing by experimenting without restrictions on simulations of human cells, tissues and organs. While it’s true we could cure ageing this way, it’s also true that we’d be able to solve any medical problem that way. I can pivot my focus on the salvation of all human diseases (including ageing).</p>
<p>But should I? Is it a better way to pitch my idea?</p>
<p>Our current longevity research is amazing. These researchers are looking directly at ageing and finding ways of extending it. One thing that sets my plan apart is that if successful it would be the eradication of all human disease. It is not limited to longevity. So should I mention this to investors when pitching it?</p>
<p>I think so. I need to find a way to incorporate this into my pitch. I was thinking near the end. I feel I must first give a specific example where this technology would be revolutionary. Something like:</p>
<p><em>Doctors were looking for the COVID-19 vaccine. If we’re able to simulate cells and tissues, we would be able to experiment directly on these simulations to immediately find the right vaccine. Overall vaccine development would be orders of magnitude faster.</em></p>
<p>Next, I can expand on this idea and talk about a future where this technology is widespread.</p>
<p><em>Not only would we be able to cure ageing, but we would also understand cancer, our brain, and find better drugs with no side effects. We would be able to engineer our body to survive in zero gravity for long periods and go to other solar systems. We would be able to alleviate suffering for all on this planet.</em></p>
<p>These are things I should include in my pitch. In the next few weeks expect me to have this pitch refined.</p>
