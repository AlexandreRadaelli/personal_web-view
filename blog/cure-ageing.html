<h1 id="i-want-to-cure-ageing">I Want To Cure Ageing</h1>
<p><em>Jan 9, 2021</em></p>
<p>I want to cure ageing. Here’s my hypothesis on how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can cure ageing by experimenting directly on humans.</li>
<li>I can experiment on humans by experimenting on simulations of humans.</li>
<li>I can simulate humans by understanding the process of chemical evolution.</li>
<li>I can understand chemical evolution by using an AI network to brute force the evolution of initial molecule systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain each point briefly before diving into the solution.</p>
<h4 id="cure-ageing-by-directly-experimenting-on-humans">Cure ageing by directly experimenting on humans</h4>
<p>The idea is simple enough. If ethics didn’t exist, we could solve any medical problems orders of magnitude faster then we currently do.</p>
<h4 id="experiment-on-humans-by-simulating-humans">Experiment on humans by simulating humans</h4>
<p>This satisfies our ethics problem. We would experiment on simulations of human cells and tissues and gain medical insights.</p>
<h4 id="simulate-humans-by-understanding-the-process-of-chemical-evolution">Simulate humans by understanding the process of chemical evolution</h4>
<p>We still can’t create life in a lab. Biology is too complex. But if we could comprehend the process of chemical evolution, where chemistry turns into biology, we would be well on our way to simulating a cell. This process is also called abiogenesis.</p>
<h4 id="understand-abiogenesis-by-using-to-ai-to-brute-force-the-evolution-of-initial-molecule-systems">Understand abiogenesis by using to AI to brute force the evolution of initial molecule systems</h4>
<p>With enough trial and error, we are bound to discover the a recipe for life. We would simulate a wide array of combinations of chemicals, and through brute force, find promissing combinations that can then be experimentally confirmed to work in a lab. If we managed to simulate the evolution of molecules into something alive, then nothing is stopping up from scaling up that simulation into cells and tissues and organs, and eventually humans.</p>
<h1 id="my-proposal">My proposal</h1>
<p>By introducing machine learning techiques to chemical evolution research, we will be able to understand life, and create simulations of cells that we will use to gain valuable medical insights.</p>
