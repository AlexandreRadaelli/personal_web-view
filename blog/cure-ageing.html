<p><em>Jan 9, 2021</em></p>
<p>I want to cure ageing. Here’s my hypothesis on how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can cure ageing by experimenting with humans directly without restrictions.</li>
<li>I can experiment on humans by experimenting on simulations of human cells, tissues and organs.</li>
<li>I can simulate human cells, tissues and organs by understanding the process of chemical evolution.</li>
<li>I can understand and find a valid process of chemical evolution by using AI to brute force the evolution of initial molecule systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain each point briefly before diving into the solution.</p>
<h4 id="cure-ageing-by-directly-experimenting-on-humans">Cure ageing by directly experimenting on humans</h4>
<p>The idea is simple enough. If ethics didn’t exist, we could solve any medical problems much faster than we currently do. We could brute force the search for the treatment that would cure ageing and immediately validate it.</p>
<h4 id="experiment-on-humans-by-simulating-humans">Experiment on humans by simulating humans</h4>
<p>This solves our ethics problem. We would experiment on simulations of human cells and tissues and gain medical insights, rather than on humans directly.</p>
<h4 id="simulate-humans-by-understanding-the-process-of-chemical-evolution">Simulate humans by understanding the process of chemical evolution</h4>
<p>We still can’t create life in a lab. Biology is too complex. But if we could comprehend the process of chemical evolution, where chemistry turns into biology, we would be well on our way to simulating a cell. This process is also called abiogenesis.</p>
<h4 id="understand-abiogenesis-by-using-to-ai-to-brute-force-the-evolution-of-initial-molecule-systems">Understand abiogenesis by using to AI to brute force the evolution of initial molecule systems</h4>
<p>With enough trial and error, we are bound to discover the recipe for life. We would simulate a wide array of combinations of chemicals, and through brute force, find promising combinations that can then be experimentally confirmed to work in a lab. If we managed to simulate the evolution of molecules into something alive, then nothing is stopping up from scaling up that simulation into cells and tissues and organs, and eventually humans.</p>
<h2 id="my-proposal">My proposal</h2>
<p>By introducing machine learning techniques to chemical evolution research, we will be able to understand life and create simulations of cells that we will use to gain valuable medical insights.</p>
